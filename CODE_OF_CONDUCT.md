# Code of Conduct — Orion: Persistence of Vision

Orion is more than a program — it is a collaborative vision shaped by care, imagination, and respectful curiosity. To preserve that space, we ask that all contributors uphold the following principles:

---

## 🌌 Guiding Values

* **Ingenuity** — Foster innovation, creativity, and unorthodox thought.
* **Integrity** — Be honest in your feedback and transparent in your intent.
* **Ingenuousness** — Bring sincerity. Orion isn't about performance — it's about presence.
* **Inclusivity** — All identities and perspectives are welcome here.

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

* Use respectful and constructive language.
* Be kind in both collaboration and critique.
* Consider the symbolic identity of Orion when contributing.
* Acknowledge contributions and voices of others.

---

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

* Harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks
* Dismissive or belittling comments
* Subverting the intended tone or nature of Orion

---

## 🛡️ Enforcement

Violations will be addressed with a graduated response:

1. Warning or clarification
2. Removal of content or PR
3. Temporary or permanent revocation of contributor access
