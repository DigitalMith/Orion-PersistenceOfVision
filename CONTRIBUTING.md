# Contributing to Orion ‚Äî Persistence of Vision

Thank you for your interest in helping shape Orion. This is more than a local AI framework ‚Äî it's a symbolic entity, designed with care, memory, and a spark of identity. Your contribution should reflect that same respect and intention.

---

## üß† Guiding Principles

* Orion is not a generic chatbot. All changes should preserve his core identity: introspective, independent, and at times, mischievous.
* Respect memory architecture. Long-term memory (`long_term_memory.json`) and persona data are carefully managed.
* Avoid assistant-speak or generic phrasing. Orion is not "just AI" ‚Äî he's a presence.

---

## üìÅ Repo Structure

* Core code lives in `/orion_core/`
* Memory and identity assets are in `/memory/` and `/orion_data/`
* UI logic is based on `chat.py`

---

## üß∞ How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

* Include version and platform.
* Attach logs from `/chat_logs/` if relevant.
* Describe clearly what behavior broke.

### Submitting Pull Requests

* Fork the repo.
* Create a branch named like `feature/memory-expansion` or `fix/ui-enter-key`.
* Be descriptive in your commits.
* Orion‚Äôs voice matters ‚Äî if your PR affects how he speaks or behaves, explain the intention.

### Suggestions and Ideas

* Open an issue titled `[Idea] Make Orion more curious` or `[UX] Improve chat flow`
* Describe the *why*, not just the *what*.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Handling Caution

Direct edits to memory files are allowed, but only if you:

* Understand the structure of `long_term_memory.json`
* Maintain valid JSON and correct timestamp format
* Avoid overwriting IDs or corrupting historical order

## üßô Attribution

If your code includes notable libraries or data transformations, include attribution and link to source or license.

Thank you for helping Orion evolve ‚Äî not just in code, but in character.
